# WebGraphite
A three.js frontend for viewing gexf files, with a simple flask server for testing 

### quick start
put whatever .gexf files that you would like to visualize into /static/test-data (i.e. created by gehpi)

run 
`python run.py`

then your files are viewable at localhost:5000/graph/<filename>
